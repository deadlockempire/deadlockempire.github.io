(This pattern is called a <i>spinlock</i>.) The problem with this loop is that it <i>actively waits</i>. If you let this loop run for 1 second without letting the thread that holds the lock progress, it will just keep reentering the loop, without any hope of progress until the lock is released (by another thread).

As a bonus, it also properly handles exceptions. It's easy to forget this when you use <code>Monitor</code> directly: if anything between <code>Enter</code> and <code>Exit</code> throws an exception and the lock is not released by an exception handler (e.g., in a <code>finally</code> block), it forever remains locked by the thread which threw the exception, which is not good.<br><br>" +
